# C-bash-Compiler
A basic C code compiler wrote in bash with error handling to make your life easier

-- TIP
You should add this to your /usr/bin folder then you should be able to call compc as a global command

example: compc test

You can easily compile C++ files by changing the 2 line to: g++ -o $1 $1.cpp
